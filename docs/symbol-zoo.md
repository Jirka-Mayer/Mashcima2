Symbol ZOO
==========

Lists symbol categories that need to by synthesized and describes why these categories exist.


## Stafflines

Stafflines are special in their size and role, so they are synthesized via a dedicated system.


## Ledger lines

- below notehead
- through a notehead
- fixed spacing
- variable spacing


## Noteheads

- full
- empty
- line
- circle
- on a ledger line
- above a ledger line
- not separate, but connected to the rest of the note fluently


## IMPORTANT! Ligatures!

An eighth note can either be drawn as three symbols (notehead, stem, flag), or one symbol drawn in one stroke. The latter is called a *ligature* - i.e. [more graphemes are joined to form a single glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing)). Same thing happens when a notehead is placed over a ledger line. There may be a separate symbol, that looks like a `+` (plus), while other noteheads look like `o` (circles).
